# Before you start

### Thank you!

Every single submission greatly strengthens our study and allows us to make more precise observations regarding our sleep in real-life conditions. We genuinely appreciate you taking the time to help us today!

### General Information

In the next page you will receive instructions on how to obtain your Android phone apps timestamps data, which is labeled as "*My Activity*" in the Google Takeout platform. Once you have received your file, we will first ask you to consent to participate in the study through an online platform, and only after doing so to fill out a short questionnaire in which you will be able to upload your file. If you choose to, you will be able to remove all apps names from the downloaded data.

It takes less than 15 minutes for most people to "order" this file from Google. I would suggest using a laptop for comfort, although it is just as easy on a phone. Click the button at the end of the page to get started.



Don't hesitate to get in touch with me if you face any issues whatsoever!
