Everyday, as we go about out lives, between sending work mails and using our phones for lots of things, we leave tons of digital footprints, probably more than we've left on the beach lately, due to the stay at home orders!

Our project tries to use these digital footprints to study rhythms in our activity, and to see what might be natural for us and what isn't. This helps us towards our goal of understanding human sleep and natural rhythms, and help people make more informed decisions about their habits and lead healthier lives.

A particular focus of our current study is the effect COVID-19 had on our work rhythms. We believe that the stay at home orders forced people into a peculiar situation, and that these changes may be very informative about what is natural for us compared to the social convention of the 9to5 work life.

Please consider taking the time out to help us. 

As a little treat for your efforts, we also offer an online tool to visualize your own data in beautiful and informative graphs, scroll further for details!


## How you can help us!

### Step 1:

Identify the kinds(s) of digital footprints that you have: 

Note that you may have more than one kind of data that we could use and we would greatly appreciate if you submit multiple files! Don't be hesitant to share your data if you feel you don't use either mode enough, the questionnaire that follows allows you to detail on how much and for what purposes you use these mediums and you'd be surprised at how helpful they may be to us!

Each file to be submitted is first viewed and de-identified by you to remove any chances of the submitted data being traced back to you. For those still concerned, we even provide options for you to pre-process the data and only submitting what you deem fit!

We are currently looking for:

This usually pertains to professionals that use e-mails as their primary means of work related communication. Professors and graduate or undergraduate students in academia also important sources of information for us.



2. <img src="https://icons-for-free.com/iconfiles/png/512/Android-1320568265274623818.png" height="30" width="30"> Android timestamps

This applies to almost anyone using an android device! It also applies if you barely use your phone, but is particularly important as a trove of information if you're someone who uses their phone all the time!
