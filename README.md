Our current study focuses on the effect COVID-19 had on our work rhythms. We believe that the stay at home orders forced people into a peculiar situation, drawn away from the social convention of the 9to5 work life and we wanted to study the nature of its impact. We believe that the digital footprints we leave when sending emails for work and using various apps on our phones give us a good way of studying these changes.

Please consider taking the time out to help us by following the steps below and sharing your data towards this cause.

As a little thank you for your efforts, we also offer an online tool to visualize your own data in beautiful and informative graphs, linked at the end of the process.

## How to help (with your data)

### Step 0: Identify the data you have

Below is a list of the kinds of data we are looking for. You may have more than one kind of data that we could use and we would greatly appreciate if you submit multiple files! Don't be hesitant to share your data even if you feel you don't use either mode enough, the questionnaire that follows allows you to detail on how much and for what purposes you use these mediums and you'd be surprised at how helpful they may be to us!

Each file to be submitted is first viewed and de-identified by you to remove any chances of the submitted data being traced back to you. For those still concerned, we even provide options for you to pre-process the data and only submitting what you deem fit!

We are currently looking for:

1. E-mail timestamps

   This usually pertains to professionals that use e-mails as their primary means of work related communication. Professors and graduate or undergraduate   students in academia also important sources of information for us. We currently support G-mail by google and Apple mail, if you use any other mail system please contact us and we will try to find a way to obtain the data!

   This applies to almost anyone using an android phone! It also applies if you barely use your phone, but is particularly great if you're someone who uses their phone all the time! We do not have a method for iPhones at this time, please consider sharing this website with android using friends and family!
