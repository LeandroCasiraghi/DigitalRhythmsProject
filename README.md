## A little info!

Google stores a lot of information about us, from most of our mails to timestamps of apps being opened on our Android phones. They normally store it to make predictions about us to improve thier revenues. We figured, if this data should be collected from us, it should benefit us directly too! 

This project attemps to study rhythms in human activity via these digital footprints, to see what may be natural for us and what isn't, and utlimately to help us as humans, make more informed decisions about our habits to live healthier lives.
