Everyday, as we go about out lives, between sending work mails and using our phones for lots of things, we leave tons of digital footprints, probably more than we've left on the beach lately, due to the stay at home orders!

Our project tries to use these digital footprints to study rhythms in our activity, and to see what might be natural for us and what isn't. This helps us towards our goal of understanding human sleep and natural rhythms, and help people make more informed decisions about their habits and lead healthier lives.

A particular focus of our current study is the effect COVID-19 had on our work rhythms. We believe that the stay at home orders forced people into a peculiar situation, and that these changes may be very informative about what is natural for us compared to the social convention of the 9to5 work life.

Please consider taking the time out to help us. 

As a little treat for your efforts, we also offer an online tool to visualize your own data in beautiful and informative graphs, scroll further for details!


## How you can help us!

### Step 1: Identifying the kinds(s) of digital footprints you leave

Below is a list of the kinds of data we are looking for. You may have more than one kind of data that we could use and we would greatly appreciate if you submit multiple files! Don't be hesitant to share your data even if you feel you don't use either mode enough, the questionnaire that follows allows you to detail on how much and for what purposes you use these mediums and you'd be surprised at how helpful they may be to us!

Each file to be submitted is first viewed and de-identified by you to remove any chances of the submitted data being traced back to you. For those still concerned, we even provide options for you to pre-process the data and only submitting what you deem fit!

We are currently looking for:

   E-mail timestamps

   This usually pertains to professionals that use e-mails as their primary means of work related communication. Professors and graduate or undergraduate   students in academia also important sources of information for us. We currently support G-mail by google and Apple mail, if you use any other mail system please contact us and we will try to find a way to obtain the data!

   Android timestamps

   This applies to almost anyone using an android phone! It also applies if you barely use your phone, but is particularly great if you're someone who uses their phone all the time! We do not have a method for iPhones at this time, please consider sharing this website with android using friends and family!

### Step 2: Consent and Questionnaires

Please ensure you've obtained a data file, viewed it and are comfortable with sharing it before moving forward. 

   <img src="https://www.flaticon.com/svg/static/icons/svg/2234/2234689.svg" height="30" width="30">

1. First, fill out the consent form <a href="https://redcap.iths.org/surveys/?s=34X3HD7YYL" target="_blank">here.</a>

   <img src="https://www.flaticon.com/premium-icon/icons/svg/2115/2115955.svg" height="30" width="30">

2. Next, submit your details and receive your *unique* 5 character code <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe9at489PROVrqA-qO2EXoz1D_5TWLJGha9GcUqO24y30u34Q/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">here</a>

   Make sure you rename each file that you will be submitting with the code! This step is independent to ensure that your name, contact and code are available together only for the consent document,and not even on our own systems.

3. Finally, once you've **re-named and de-identified** the file, upload that and fill out the questionnaire <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmus7ZGrjeCBVHGkXRey-aU1y0DbflYQ1iivucsFOyBtBSHg/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">here</a>

   and you're done! We hope it did not take too long for you!
   
   A sincere thank you from the de la Iglesia lab at the University of Washington, Seattle!
