# Before you start

### Thank you!

Every single submission greatly increases the reach and generalizability of this study and I genuinely appreciate you taking the time to help us out.

### General Information

In the next page you will see instructions on how to obtain your Android phone apps timestamps data, which is labeled "My Activity" in the Google Takeout platform. Once you receive your file we will ask you to provide consent to participate in the study, and finally to fill out a questionnaire in which you will be also able to upload your file.  If you choose to, you will be able to remove all apps names from the downloaded data.

It takes less than 15 minutes for most people to "order" this file from Google. Click the button at the end of the page to get started.

I would suggest using a laptop for comfort, although it is just as easy on a phone.

Don't hesitate to get in touch with me if you face any issues whatsoever! 

~ Leandro
