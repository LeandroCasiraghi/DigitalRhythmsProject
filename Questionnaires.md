## Visualize the data yourself!

As a little thank you for your effort, we invite you to use the this specially designed Colab notebook that will allow you to visualize your own data in just a few clicks, and help you learn some interesting things about yourself and your daily patterns. This is not linked to our research in any way, and you won't have to provide any data. Everything can be done on your own end, for your personal enjoyment :)
