# Step 2 of 2: Consent and Questionnaires

Please ensure you've obtained a data file, viewed it and are comfortable with sharing it before moving forward. 

1.  First, fill out the consent form <a href="https://redcap.iths.org/surveys/?s=34X3HD7YYL" target="_blank">here.</a>

2.  Next, submit your details and receive your *unique* 5 character code <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIIiCoDeyHSJua0dggl3DbIPoXbTsXZiq2M7ozJJpS9qKqWA/viewform" target="_blank">here</a>
    
    ***Please use the links from this page and not the one offered when you submit this form***

    Make sure you rename each file that you will be submitting with the code! This step is independent to ensure that your name, contact and code are available together only for the consent document, and not even on our own systems.

3. Finally, once you've **re-named and de-identified** the file, upload that and fill out the questionnaire <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmus7ZGrjeCBVHGkXRey-aU1y0DbflYQ1iivucsFOyBtBSHg/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">here</a>

    Helping notes:
    
    1. You only need to upload once, for android - html, of the three upload options. Please select "no" for "did you upload email data" and "yes" for "did you submit android data"
    
    2. The form is common for e-mail timestamps and android timestamps, do **NOT** answer the questions that are asked towards a data type you are not submitting. (Both android and e-mail have one section specifically pertaining to them, and the data collection page is common to both, other sections are for both)
    
    3. Vacation days regard large holidays like semester breaks,days when you were being taught online is counted as a working day
    
    4. Your data from Last October to present will be used, so please mention any large vacations between October 2019 to December 2020.
